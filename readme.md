This repository contains my solutions to the coding challenges from reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer.
I try to solve these challenges to keep up and sharpen my programming skills mostly with python and C++.
Each folder contains a presentation of the problem (copied word for word from its reddit post), and my
solution.
